      "longDescription": "After taking moviegoers magically into the realm of toys, bugs, monsters, fish, and superheroes, the masterful storytellers and technical wizards at Pixar Animation Studios, and Academy Award®-winning director John Lasseter (Toy Story, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life), hit the road with a fast-paced comedy adventure set inside the world of cars. Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a hotshot rookie race car driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in California to compete against two seasoned pros, Lightning McQueen gets to know the town's offbeat characters –including Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), and a rusty but trusty tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) – who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship. The all-star vocal cast also includes free-wheeling performances by Tony Shalhoub, Michael Keaton, George Carlin, Katherine Helmond, Cheech Marin, John Ratzenberger, Paul Dooley, Michael Wallis, Darrell Waltrip, racing legend Richard Petty, Jenifer Lewis and Jeremy Piven. Fueled with plenty of humor, action, heartfelt drama, and amazing new technical feats, Cars is a high octane delight for moviegoers of all ages.",

Since ending the energy crisis in Monstropolis, this pair can still get into quite a predicament. Mike's pride in his new wheels is only surpassed by Sulley's lack of skills at the control panel. The two eventually agree on one thing: walking to work might be the best, at least today. Director Pete Docter came up with the idea for Mike's New Car long before directing Monsters, Inc. When the opportunity arose to create a short film featuring Mike and Sulley, Docter dusted off his shelved idea, put Mike in the driver's seat, and added some classic Laurel and Hardy moments to create a curbside comedy that puts the pedal to the metal."

It's just a typical day in the lives of the employees, customers and passersby of a Los Angeles car wash - but what a day! There's a would-be robbery... an assembly line of the weirdest, baddest, shadiest characters you've ever met... and lots of booty-bumping music to pass the hours until quitting time. Featuring outrageously hilarious performances by George Carlin, \"Professor\" Irwin Corey, The Pointer Sisters, and Richard Pryor as Daddy Rich, a flamboyant Reverend who preaches the goodness of the dollar, Car Wash is a timeless classic celebrating an era devoted to living life in the fast lane."

      "longDescription": "REVENGE OF THE ELECTRIC CAR presents the recent resurgence of electric vehicles as seen through the eyes of four pioneers of the EV revolution. Director Chris Paine (Who Killed the Electric Car?) has had unprecedented access to the electric car research and development programs at General Motors, Nissan, and Tesla Motors, while also following a part time electric car converter who refuses to wait for the international car makers to create the electric cars the public demands. As more models of electric cars than ever before start to arrive in showrooms and driveways across the world, Chris Paine's film offers an inspiring, entertaining and definitive account of this revolutionary moment in human transportation. REVENGE OF THE ELECTRIC CAR follows these auto makers as they race each other to create the first, best, and most publicly accepted electric cars for the new car market."

      "longDescription": "Roger Moore is Dr. Judd Stevens, a rather meek Chicago psychiatrist whose patient is killed while wearing a jacket borrowed from Stevens. After Stevens' secretary is brutally slain, Lieutenant McGreavy (Rod Steiger) is certain that Stevens is guilty and is ready to prove it, but when his vendetta gets too obvious, he is taken off the case. That leaves his partner Angeli (Elliott Gould), a much more sympathetic cop, to continue on with the investigation. Even then, the killings continue, so Stevens gives up on the police and goes for help to a wacky P.I. (Art Carney) who lives surrounded by clocks and at first seems like a hopeless nitwit. As Stevens continues in his pursuit of the killers, life is complicated by a Mafia bride who seeks his professional help and clues that lead increasingly to the Mafia and cops on the take."
